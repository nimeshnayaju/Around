# Around

Around is an iOS app that notifies users to look around when the app detects the user is walking and using their phone at the same time for a certain amount of time. Around is written in Swift and utlizes the CoreMotion framework to detect if the user is walking.

## TODO

- [x] Add interactive local notification to look around with options to disable notifications for 30 minutes or 1 hour. 
- [x] Allow user to customize the time they'd like the app to notify when it detects the user has been walking while using their phone.
- [x] Allow the app to run in background with efficient battery consumption.
